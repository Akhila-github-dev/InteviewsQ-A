1.roles and responsibilities in project?
i am one of the developer in the project. I have worked on agile methodology. Based on the requirement from the 
story we use to do code configuration. we use to analyze the story, make necessary code changes. i use to do local
deployment, local testing and committing code changes and do deployment. if we got any issue we use to analyze
the issue , debugging the issue checking splunck logs and resloving it.
=======================================================================
what are the code changes you have done?
code changes i have done are i have written Junit test cases,
2. i have to populate one id in report. i have worked on report geneartion model there we need to populate one Id
in the report i have written logic for it.
3. we are getting one csv file( comma separated file). we have written logic to extract values from it and
store it in a list and save it db.
4. JWT filter(security)
5. we had a client requirement for particular method it is throwing exception. it should not throw the error. so 
we have removed it(better not to say)
6. zero should not be shown at frontend 
7. we need to unnecessary code which is take more deployment time. after doing it deployement speed is increased
8. oracle db migration from 12c to 19c. db testing i have done. checking 2 db has same data.

=======================================================================
Can you describe a challenging project you worked on?
the challenges i have faced in my project in security setup. like managing the user login token across the 
all the services. to reslove this we have jwt filter. 
============================================================================
What technologies did you use?
java, spring , spring jdbc, sql.
======================================================================
How did you optimize performance in your project?
we noticed that API response times were slow due to redundant database queries. Using a profiling tool, 
we identified excessive calls to the same table. To fix this, we introduced Redis caching to store
frequently accessed data, reducing database load. Additionally, we optimized SQL queries by adding indexes.
As a result, response times improved from 1.5s to 200ms, significantly enhancing system performance and user
experience.
===========================================================================
Did you use caching, multithreading, or database indexing?
In our banking project, we implemented multithreading for concurrent transaction processing. 
When multiple users initiate transactions, we use Java’s ExecutorService to ensure efficient parallel
execution while maintaining data integrity."
=================================================================================
How did you measure performance improvements?
In our banking project, we integrated Spring Boot Actuator to monitor API performance.
Using /actuator/metrics/http.server.requests, we tracked response times before and after caching 
implementation. This helped us validate the optimization, reducing latency from 1.8s to 300ms."
=================================================================================
Explain a scenario where you had to debug a complex issue in your project.
security issue we can say.
=================================================================================
What debugging tools or techniques did you use?
we used Splunk to analyze application logs and identify transaction failures. 
It helped us pinpoint errors quickly and reduce debugging time.

IDE Debuggers: Used Eclipse for setting breakpoints and stepping through code.
Logging & Monitoring: Used Log4j, SLF4J, and Spring Boot Actuator for application health tracking.
Profiling Tools: Utilized JProfiler, VisualVM, JConsole to analyze performance bottlenecks.
Load Testing: Used JMeter & Gatling for identifying scaling issues.


=================================================================================
How did you resolve the issue?
by using splunk only we have analyze the issue where it is causing and debugging it and tried to reslove it.
=================================================================================
How do you ensure code quality in your projects?
using junit test cases and checking the code coverage we can check the code quality.sonar qube for code quality.
=================================================================================
Do you follow design patterns, unit testing, or code reviews?
Design Patterns "Yes, I follow design patterns to ensure code scalability, maintainability, and efficiency. In CashPro Connect,
given its focus on secure financial transactions, patterns like Singleton for managing shared configurations, Factory for object creation, 
and Observer for event-driven processing are particularly useful."

Unit Testing "I prioritize writing unit tests to ensure code reliability and prevent regressions. I use JUnit and Mockito for testing 
services, controllers, and repositories. In a banking project like CashPro Connect, testing edge cases such as transaction failures,
concurrency handling, and security validation is crucial."

Code Reviews "I actively participate in code reviews to maintain code quality and align with best practices. I look for readability,
performance optimization, adherence to design patterns, and security considerations—especially relevant in a financial platform like CashPro Connect."
=================================================================================
How do you invoke third party apis in your project?
Using RestTemplate
“RestTemplate is a synchronous HTTP client provided by Spring. It’s simple and widely used for calling REST APIs.”

@Service
public class ApiService {

    @Autowired
    private RestTemplate restTemplate;

    public String getDataFromApi() {
        String url = "https://api.example.com/data";
        ResponseEntity<String> response = restTemplate.getForEntity(url, String.class);
        return response.getBody();
    }
}


@Configuration
public class AppConfig {
    @Bean
    public RestTemplate restTemplate() {
        return new RestTemplate();
    }
}

“FeignClient is a declarative REST client from Spring Cloud. It simplifies API calls by abstracting the HTTP layer.
@FeignClient(name = "externalApi", url = "https://api.example.com")
public interface ExternalApiClient {
    @GetMapping("/data")
    String getData();
}

@Service
public class ApiService {

    @Autowired
    private ExternalApiClient externalApiClient;

    public String fetchData() {
        return externalApiClient.getData();
    }
}

===================================================================================
Where did you use abstract classes and interfaces in your project?

I created an abstract class called TransactionProcessor, which contained common logic such as validation, logging, and security token handling. 
The method processTransaction() was defined as abstract because the actual implementation varied by transaction type.
I used abstract classes in CashPro Connect to share common logic across multiple types of transaction processors, enforcing a template pattern.
I used interfaces to define service contracts like API and file connectors, allowing the system to support different protocols without changing the core processing logic.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Your API returns 500 in production — how do you debug it?

"In an interview, if I were debugging a 500 error in CashPro production, I’d start by reviewing server and application logs for specific error details.
I’d verify that the API requests are correctly formed and not exceeding rate limits or misusing authentication. I’d check for database issues or external system failures, 
as these are common causes. If the error persists, I’d test the request using Postman or cURL to replicate the issue and isolate the cause. Lastly, if needed, I’d reach out 
to CashPro support for guidance or check their status page for service disruptions."
