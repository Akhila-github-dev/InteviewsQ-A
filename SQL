 Goal: Get
emp_name (Employee name) (from employee table)
manager_name (Using self join) (from employee table)
dept_name (From department table)

SELECT 
    e.emp_name AS employee_name,
    m.emp_name AS manager_name,
    d.dept_name AS department_name
FROM 
    employee e
LEFT JOIN 
    employee m ON e.manager_id = m.emp_id
LEFT JOIN 
    department d ON e.dept_id = d.dept_id;

We use LEFT JOIN to ensure that:
Even if an employee doesn't have a manager (e.g., CEO), it still shows up.
Even if a department is not assigned, the employee still appears.
================================================================
SELECT 
    e.emp_name,
    d.dept_name
FROM 
    employee e
JOIN 
    department d ON e.dept_id = d.dept_id;
==================================================
You're describing a search/autocomplete feature where:
You have a table (let‚Äôs say packet) containing plan names.
These plan names can start with different characters like A, B, C, S, etc.
When a user starts typing (e.g., "S"), it should return all plan names containing or starting with "S", such as "Silver", "CB Silver", etc.

The user should be able to type partially or select from suggestions.

‚úÖ Table: packet
Column	Description
packet_id	Unique ID of the plan
plan_name	Name of the plan (e.g., "Silver", "CB Silver", "Basic A", etc.)

‚úÖ SQL Query for Search (Case-Insensitive)

SELECT 
    plan_name 
FROM 
    packet 
WHERE 
    LOWER(plan_name) LIKE LOWER('%s%');
üî∏ If user types "S", this will return any plan that contains S or s in any position.

üîç If you want plans that start with the character:

SELECT 
    plan_name 
FROM 
    packet 
WHERE 
    LOWER(plan_name) LIKE LOWER('s%');
‚úÖ Returns: Silver, Standard, Super Plan
‚ùå Doesn't return: CB Silver, Pro Silver

üîç If you want plans that contain the search text anywhere:

SELECT 
    plan_name 
FROM 
    packet 
WHERE 
    LOWER(plan_name) LIKE LOWER('%silver%');
‚úÖ This is useful for partial matching and autocomplete suggestions.

‚úÖ Integration in Java (Spring Boot)
If you're using Spring Boot + JPA, you can define a method like:

@Repository
public interface PacketRepository extends JpaRepository<Packet, Long> {

    // Search plans containing any keyword (case-insensitive)
    List<Packet> findByPlanNameContainingIgnoreCase(String keyword);

    // Or, for plans starting with the keyword
    List<Packet> findByPlanNameStartingWithIgnoreCase(String keyword);
}
‚úÖ Frontend (Autocomplete Suggestion)
You can create an endpoint:

@RestController
@RequestMapping("/api/packets")
public class PacketController {

    @Autowired
    private PacketRepository packetRepository;

    @GetMapping("/search")
    public List<Packet> searchPlans(@RequestParam String keyword) {
        return packetRepository.findByPlanNameContainingIgnoreCase(keyword);
    }
}
üß† Example:
URL: GET /api/packets/search?keyword=s
Returns: [ "Silver", "CB Silver", "Super Plan" ]
=====================================================
Table: Employee
emp_id	 emp_name	 dept_id
1      	Alice	    101
2	       Bob     	102
3	      Charlie  	NULL
4	      David	   103

Table: Department
dept_id  	dept_name
101        	HR
102	        Finance
104         	Marketing

‚úÖ 1. INNER JOIN
Returns rows where there is a match in both tables.

SELECT e.emp_name, d.dept_name
FROM Employee e
INNER JOIN Department d ON e.dept_id = d.dept_id;
üîπ Result:
emp_name	 dept_name
Alice    	HR
Bob       	Finance

üìå Explanation:
Only Alice (101) and Bob (102) matched.
Charlie (NULL) and David (103 ‚Äì no matching dept) are excluded.

‚úÖ 2. LEFT JOIN (or LEFT OUTER JOIN)
Returns all rows from the left table (Employee), and matched rows from right table (Department). If no match, fills with NULL.

SELECT e.emp_name, d.dept_name
FROM Employee e
LEFT JOIN Department d ON e.dept_id = d.dept_id;
üîπ Result:
emp_name  	dept_name
Alice	     HR
Bob	       Finance
Charlie	   NULL
David	     NULL

üìå Explanation:
All Employees are returned.
Charlie and David don‚Äôt have matching departments ‚Üí NULL for dept_name.

‚úÖ 3. RIGHT JOIN (or RIGHT OUTER JOIN)
Returns all rows from the right table (Department), and matched rows from left table (Employee). If no match, fills with NULL.

üîπ Query:
sql
Copy
Edit
SELECT e.emp_name, d.dept_name
FROM Employee e
RIGHT JOIN Department d ON e.dept_id = d.dept_id;
üîπ Result:
emp_name	dept_name
Alice	HR
Bob	Finance
NULL	Marketing

üìå Explanation:

All Departments are returned.

No employee is in Marketing (104) ‚Üí emp_name is NULL.

‚úÖ 4. FULL OUTER JOIN (if supported)
Returns all rows when there is a match in either table. If no match, fills with NULL.

üîπ Query (not supported in MySQL directly):
sql
Copy
Edit
SELECT e.emp_name, d.dept_name
FROM Employee e
FULL OUTER JOIN Department d ON e.dept_id = d.dept_id;
üîπ Result:
emp_name	dept_name
Alice	HR
Bob	Finance
Charlie	NULL
David	NULL
NULL	Marketing

üìå Explanation:

Includes all Employees and all Departments.

Missing matches filled with NULL.

‚úÖ 5. CROSS JOIN
Returns all possible combinations (Cartesian Product).

üîπ Query:
sql
Copy
Edit
SELECT e.emp_name, d.dept_name
FROM Employee e
CROSS JOIN Department d;
üîπ Result:
emp_name	dept_name
Alice	HR
Alice	Finance
Alice	Marketing
Bob	HR
Bob	Finance
Bob	Marketing
Charlie	HR
Charlie	Finance
Charlie	Marketing
David	HR
David	Finance
David	Marketing

üìå Explanation:
Every employee paired with every department.

‚úÖ Visual Summary Table
Join Type	Rows Returned
INNER JOIN (default)	Matching rows from both tables
LEFT JOIN	All rows from left + matches on right
RIGHT JOIN	All rows from right + matches on left
FULL OUTER JOIN	All rows from both tables
CROSS JOIN	All combinations (Cartesian product)
