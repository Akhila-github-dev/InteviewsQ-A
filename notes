Idempotency 
Ensure operations are idempotent, meaning repated execution has the same effect. this helps avoid duplication and inconsistency during retries.

an idempotent api guarantees that repated calls with the same parameters will not change the result beyon the initail application.

Get:always idempotent(fetches data).
put: should be idempotent(updates a resource)
delete: hould be idempotent (removes a resource)
post : not idemptent by default, but can be made idempotent using techniques like idempotency keys.
