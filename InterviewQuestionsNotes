copart Interview

1. Coding Question :
 
input : "abc", "def", "ghi"
output : ["adg", "beh", "cfi"]
=================================================================== 
2. Explain some of inbuilt functional Interfaces introduced in Java 8 ?
Ans : function, supplier, predict, consumer and bifuction
BiFuntion: Similar to Function<T, R>, but takes two inputs (T, U) and returns a result (R).
example - reduce.
=================================================================================================
3. What will happen when I throw an exception from foreach method of java 8 ?
import java.util.List;
Ans :- If an exception occurs in forEach, the iteration stops immediately, and remaining elements will not be processed.

public class ForEachExceptionDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        List<Integer> numbers = List.of(1, 2, 3, 4, 5);

        try {
            numbers.forEach(num -> {
                if (num == 3) {
                    throw new RuntimeException("Exception at number " + num);
                }
                System.out.println(num);
            });
        } catch (Exception e) {
            System.out.println("Caught Exception: " + e.getMessage());
        }
    }
}
output 
1
2
Caught Exception: Exception at number 3

 If you want to continue processing despite errors, use try-catch inside forEach
numbers.forEach(num -> {
    try {
        if (num == 3) throw new RuntimeException("Exception at number " + num);
        System.out.println(num);
    } catch (Exception e) {
        System.out.println("Handled Exception: " + e.getMessage());
    }
});
output
1
2
Handled Exception: Exception at number 3

=======================================================================================
5. How can you handle exceptions in spring boot
 Ans- @RestControllerAdvice and @ExceptionalHandler 
@RestControllerAdvice
public class GlobalExceptionHandler {

    @ExceptionHandler(Exception.class)
    public ResponseEntity<String> handleGlobalException(Exception ex) {
        return new ResponseEntity<>("Something went wrong: " + ex.getMessage(), HttpStatus.INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR);
    }
}
using responseStatusException for simple exception without defining in custom handlers
@GetMapping("/user/{id}")
public String getUser(@PathVariable int id) {
    if (id <= 0) {
        throw new ResponseStatusException(HttpStatus.BAD_REQUEST, "Invalid User ID");
    }
    return "User " + id;
}
============================================================================
6. You are given a requirement where
1. sales person needs to accept pdf file and process it and return it
2. Marketing person needs to accept doc and process it and return it
3. Enterprise person needs to accept excel and process it and return it
 
   Design and Create an application which includes security as well using single method.
============================================================================
7. Create a custom exception in java
by extending with exception class
===========================================================================
8. Lets say you have two DB operations you need to perform where you need to save data.where one second operation got failed how can you handle this scenario with out interrupting application ?
using @Transtional annotation
if the second save opertion fails, the first one will also be rolled back, preventing inconsistent data
@Service
class myservice{
@Autowired
private MyRepository res;

@Transactional 
public void saveData(DataEntity entity1, DataEntity entity2){
try{
res.save(entity1);
res.save(entity2);
}catch(Exception e){
syso("second operation failed");
throw e;
}
}
If you don't want to roll back the first operation and want the application to keep running, you can catch the exception for the second operation and log it instead of rolling back the first.
public void saveDate(DataEntity e1, DataEntity e2){
try{
rep.save(e1);
}catch(Exception e){
syso("first opertion failed");
}
try{
rep.save(e2);
}catch(Exception e){
syso("second opertion failed");
}
}
===========================================================================

9. Follow up to qn 8 where in between two db operations in b/w one statement is  there where exception occurs, this exception is not related to db how can you handle this ?
If the exception should not affect the database operations, you can catch it separately
@Transactional
public void saveDate(DataEntity e1, DataEntity e2){
try{
rep.save(e1);
processSomething();
}catch(NonDatabaseException e){
syso("non db opertion failed");
}
}
if processSomething() throws an exception, it is caught, and the transaction continues.
The database operations will not be rolled back, so entity1 and entity2 are still saved.
(or)
If you want everything to roll back, including the database operations, you need to throw a runtime exception
@Transactional
public void saveDate(DataEntity e1, DataEntity e2){
rep.save(e1);
try{
processSomething();
}catch(Exception e){
syso("critical failure");
throw new CustomException("rolling back due to failure");
}
rep.save(e2);
}
Since CustomException is thrown, Spring’s transaction manager will roll back everything.
(or)
Using Propagation.REQUIRES_NEW for Independent Transactions
If you want each operation to run independently, so failure in one part doesn’t impact the other:
@Transactional(propagation= Progagation.Requires_NEW)
public void saveEntity(DataEntity entity){
rep.save(entity):
}
this ensures each db operation runs in its own transaction, meaning failure in one does not impact the others
================================================================================

10. What do you know about actuators in spring boot ?
used for monitoring and managing the application health check metrics
adding spring boot starter actuator dependency and in app.properties
managment.endpoints.web.exposure.include=health,metrics,info
and http://localhost:8080/actuator/health
=========================================================================
11. Lets say you have kafka dependency, where kafka is down. what would be the status of Actuator at this point(UP/DOWN) ?
By default, Spring Boot does not automatically mark the application as DOWN if Kafka is unavailable.
The Actuator /actuator/health endpoint will still return UP, unless an explicit health check is defined for Kafka.
Configuring Kafka Health Indicator
Spring Boot supports Kafka health indicators, but you must include Actuator’s health monitoring for Kafka:
management.health.kafka.enabled=true
Once enabled:
If Kafka is running, /actuator/health → UP
If Kafka is down, /actuator/health → DOWN
==================================================================================
12. Explain asynchronous programming in java and how can you achieve this using spring boot ?
Ans - Asynchronous programming allows tasks to run independently without blocking the main execution thread. 
This improves performance, especially for tasks involving I/O operations, network calls, or computations.
Approaches for Asynchronous Programming in Java:
1. Using Threads 2. ExecutorService & Future 3.completableFuture 4.Reactive Programming

Achieving Asynchronous Programming in Spring Boot using @Async


@Configuration
@EnableAsync
public class AsyncConfig {
}

->Use @Async on methods that should run asynchronously.

@Service
public class AsyncService {
    @Async
    public CompletableFuture<String> asyncMethod() {
        return CompletableFuture.supplyAsync(() -> "Hello, Async!");
    }
}

->Call the Async Method: The method executes in a separate thread without blocking the caller.

@Autowired
private AsyncService asyncService;

public void executeAsyncTask() {
    CompletableFuture<String> result = asyncService.asyncMethod();
    result.thenAccept(System.out::println);
}


===============================================================================================
13. How can we create threads in java other than runnable/Thread class ?
1. callable
Callable is similar to Runnable, but it can return a result and throw exceptions.Future is used to retrieve the result of an asynchronous computation.

2. ExecutorService 
3. CompletableFuture
==============================================================================================
14. When Actually the return type Future will come in asynchronous programming ?

15. How many ways to create thread pools in Java
 
 
 
16. What are the projects you have worked on ?
17. How was your day as a java developer every day. explain your roles and responsibilities ?
18. Explain ConcurrentHashMap in Java ?
 
 
19. How you have implemented security in your project ?
20. Have you seen the code that had written in project for JWT authentication ? Explain how it works ?
21. What are the differences you have observed while migrating from SB-2 to SB-3 ?
===============================================================================================
22. Lets say we have 2 db's where you need to connect two db's in same environment with two tables. How can you achieve this.
To achieve this, we configured multiple DataSource beans in Spring Boot, defining connection details in 
application.yml. We then created separate EntityManagerFactory instances for both databases, ensuring 
independent transaction management.
For data access, we implemented two JpaRepository interfaces—one for each database—allowing seamless 
retrieval and updates. With this setup, our service layer could fetch data from both databases
simultaneously, ensuring efficient communication.
we will use  @Primary in for primary db connection in configuration class

->you can configure multiple DataSource beans and use @Primary and @Qualifier annotations to manage them
1)defining properties application.properties or yml file
spring:
  datasource:
    db1:
      url: jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/db1
      username: user1
      password: pass1
      driver-class-name: com.mysql.cj.jdbc.Driver

    db2:
      url: jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/db2
      username: user2
      password: pass2
      driver-class-name: com.mysql.cj.jdbc.Driver
2)Create Configuration Classes for Each DataSource

@Configuration
@EnableTransactionManagement
@EnableJpaRepositories(
    basePackages = "com.example.repo.db1",
    entityManagerFactoryRef = "db1EntityManagerFactory",
    transactionManagerRef = "db1TransactionManager"
)
public class Db1Config {

    @Primary
    @Bean(name = "db1DataSource")
    @ConfigurationProperties(prefix = "spring.datasource.db1")
    public DataSource dataSource() {
        return DataSourceBuilder.create().build();
    }

    @Primary
    @Bean(name = "db1EntityManagerFactory")
    public LocalContainerEntityManagerFactoryBean entityManagerFactory(
            EntityManagerFactoryBuilder builder,
            @Qualifier("db1DataSource") DataSource dataSource) {
        return builder
                .dataSource(dataSource)
                .packages("com.example.model.db1")
                .persistenceUnit("db1")
                .build();
    }

    @Primary
    @Bean(name = "db1TransactionManager")
    public PlatformTransactionManager transactionManager(
            @Qualifier("db1EntityManagerFactory") EntityManagerFactory entityManagerFactory) {
        return new JpaTransactionManager(entityManagerFactory);
    }
}


@Configuration
@EnableTransactionManagement
@EnableJpaRepositories(
    basePackages = "com.example.repo.db2",
    entityManagerFactoryRef = "db2EntityManagerFactory",
    transactionManagerRef = "db2TransactionManager"
)
public class Db2Config {

    @Bean(name = "db2DataSource")
    @ConfigurationProperties(prefix = "spring.datasource.db2")
    public DataSource dataSource() {
        return DataSourceBuilder.create().build();
    }

    @Bean(name = "db2EntityManagerFactory")
    public LocalContainerEntityManagerFactoryBean entityManagerFactory(
            EntityManagerFactoryBuilder builder,
            @Qualifier("db2DataSource") DataSource dataSource) {
        return builder
                .dataSource(dataSource)
                .packages("com.example.model.db2")
                .persistenceUnit("db2")
                .build();
    }

    @Bean(name = "db2TransactionManager")
    public PlatformTransactionManager transactionManager(
            @Qualifier("db2EntityManagerFactory") EntityManagerFactory entityManagerFactory) {
        return new JpaTransactionManager(entityManagerFactory);
    }
}
3: Create Entity and Repository Classes
Place entities for db1 in com.example.model.db1
Place entities for db2 in com.example.model.db2
Repositories go in com.example.repo.db1 and com.example.repo.db2
 4: Use Repositories in Services

@Service
public class MyService {

    @Autowired
    private Db1Repository db1Repo;

    @Autowired
    private Db2Repository db2Repo;

    public void syncData() {
        List<Entity1> list = db1Repo.findAll();
        db2Repo.saveAll(transform(list));
    }
}

 @Transactional annotation in Spring Boot is used to manage database transactions automatically. When applied to a method or class, it ensures that all database operations within the method are executed within a single transaction. If any exception occurs, the transaction is rolled back, ensuring data consistency. It simplifies transaction management in applications

Managerial round
1.Roles and resposibilities
2.How u will get data in your application
A:"In our application, we typically get data from multiple sources depending on the use case. These might include user input through the interface, 
external APIs, databases like MySQL or MongoDB, or streaming data from services like Kafka. The data is then processed, validated, and used within 
the application for display, decision-making, or analytics. We also focus on ensuring data integrity and security throughout this process."
3.what u will do if db failed in microservices.
A: We can achieve this through various strategies like retry mechanisms with exponential backoff, circuit breakers to avoid cascading failures, and 
fallback procedures for non-critical operations and aslo Redis for caching.
4.In our application how you will monitor and improve performance .
A:Actuator configuring, browser check, Redis cache , indexes for faster retrieval, time complexity and space complexity.
