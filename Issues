=====================================================
✅ Low-level HTTP Client – Requires explicit configurations for headers, authentication, and serialization. ✅ Manual Handling – You have to manually create request bodies and parse responses. ✅ More Control – Allows fine-tuned customizations.
=============================================
The @Transactional annotation in Spring Boot is used to manage database transactions automatically. When applied to a method or class, it ensures that all database operations within the method are executed within a single transaction. If any exception occurs, the transaction is rolled back, ensuring data consistency. It simplifies transaction management in applications
