1.Roles and resposibilities
2.How u will get data in your application
A:"In our application, we typically get data from multiple sources depending on the use case. These might include user input through the interface, 
external APIs, databases like MySQL or MongoDB, or streaming data from services like Kafka. The data is then processed, validated, and used within 
the application for display, decision-making, or analytics. We also focus on ensuring data integrity and security throughout this process."
3.what u will do if db failed in microservices.
A: We can achieve this through various strategies like retry mechanisms with exponential backoff, circuit breakers to avoid cascading failures, and 
fallback procedures for non-critical operations and aslo Redis for caching.
4.In our application how you will monitor and improve performance .
A:Actuator configuring, browser check, Redis cache , indexes for faster retrieval, time complexity and space complexity.
